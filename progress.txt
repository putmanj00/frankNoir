Start Date: 2026-02-08
Target: 2026-02-14 (Valentine's Day)
Timeline: 6 days

## Project Overview
Creating an immersive scavenger hunt experience for my wife that recreates 14 years of relationship history across Cincinnati locations. The experience mimics EXIT: The game with puzzles, GPS tracking, and a "Lisa Frank Noir" aesthetic (cyberpunk/synthwave with neon on black).

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- HeroUI + Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Client-only (no backend)
- localStorage for persistence
- Geolocation API for GPS
- Web Audio API for puzzles
- PWA (installable)
- Vercel hosting

## Story Log
(Ralph will append here after each story completion)

## 2026-02-08 - Story #E1-S1: Initialize Next.js 16 project with HeroUI + Tailwind

**Implementation**:
- Installed Next.js 16.1.6, React 19, TypeScript 5.9
- Installed and configured HeroUI 2.8.8 with Tailwind CSS 4
- Set up TypeScript in strict mode with proper paths (@/*)
- Created basic App Router structure with layout and page components
- Configured JetBrains Mono font via Google Fonts
- Created globals.css with Lisa Frank Noir color tokens as CSS variables

**Files Changed**:
- package.json - Added all dependencies and dev scripts
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript config with strict mode
- tailwind.config.ts - Tailwind + HeroUI config with custom colors
- next.config.js - Next.js config with HeroUI transpilePackages
- postcss.config.mjs - PostCSS config for Tailwind
- app/layout.tsx - Root layout with HeroUIProvider and JetBrains Mono
- app/page.tsx - Basic home page placeholder
- app/globals.css - Color tokens, glassmorphism, and gradient button styles
- .gitignore - Standard Next.js gitignore
- .eslintrc.json - ESLint config

**Testing**:
- Ran `npm run typecheck` - passes without errors
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Project structure matches planned architecture

**Learnings**:
- create-next-app has interactive prompts, manual setup was faster for automation
- HeroUI requires transpilePackages config in next.config.js
- CSS variables defined in :root for easy access throughout the app
- Tailwind 4 is more streamlined than v3
